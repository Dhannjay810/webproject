<tr align="center"><strong>Descrete Mathematics</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="yellow"><strong>The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, students will need a solid background in these subjects.Many students, especially bright and motivated students, find algebra, geometry, and even calculus dull and uninspiring. Rarely is this the case with most discrete math topics. When we ask students what their favorite topic is, most respond either “combinatorics” or “number theory.” (When we ask them what their least favorite topic is, the overwhelming response is “geometry.”) Simply put, most students find discrete math more fun than algebra or geometry. </strong></td></tr><br>

<tr align="center"><strong>C Programming Language</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="skyblue"><strong>'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.
'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.Another feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.</strong></td></tr><br>

<tr align="center"><strong>Computer Architecture</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="lamonade green"><strong>The architecture is the programmer's view of a computer. It is defined by the instruction set (language) and operand locations (registers and memory). Many different architectures exist, such as ARM, x86, MIPS, SPARC, and PowerPC. The first step in understanding any computer architecture is to learn its language. </strong></td></tr><br>

<tr align="center"><strong>Operating System</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="bright orange"><strong>An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</strong></td></tr><br>

<tr align="center"><strong>Business Organization</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="magenta"><strong>The term business organization describes how businesses are structured and how their structure helps them meet their goals. In general, businesses are designed to focus on either generating profit or improving society. When a business focuses on generating profits, it is known as a for-profit organization. When an organization focuses on improving the social good through the arts,education, health care, or some other area, it is known as a nonprofit (or not-for-profit) organization and is not typically referred to as a business.
There are different categories of business organizations that relate to how the business is established, owned, and operated. The basic categories of business organization are sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation. Each type of business organization has benefits as well as disadvantages. </strong></td></tr><br>

<tr align="center"><strong>Web Development LAB-1</strong><td align="left" bgcolor="green"><strong>Technology plays a huge role in our daily lives, from the simplest of apps to the most groundbreaking inventions. Every website or piece of software that we encounter has been built by a web developer—but what exactly is  web development, and what does a web developer do?
To the outside eye, it can seem like a complicated, confusing and somewhat inaccessible field. So, to shed some light on this fascinating industry, we’ve put together the ultimate introduction to web development and what it takes to become a fully-fledged web developer.</strong></td></tr>
